# JuliaSIG

This is the official repository of the Special Interest Group (SIG) Julia Programming Language at the University of Birmingham (UoB).


The Special Interest Group was established in November 2024 by Dr Vincenzo Brachetta, with the aim of supporting the growing community of Julia users and enabling researchers to benefit from this innovative programming language.


Julia (https://julialang.org) is a high-performance and relatively recent programming language, the development of which commenced in 2009 and culminated in its official release in 2012. Its principal objective is to resolve the long-standing 'two-language problem' (Bezanson et al., 2017). Julia has been demonstrated to achieve performance comparable to that of C, while retaining a syntax similar to Python, as evidenced by various numerical benchmarks (Bezanson et al., 2017; Guillaume, 2022).
